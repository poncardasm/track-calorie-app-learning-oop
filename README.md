# Track Calorie App - Learning OOP Project

This repository contains my learning journey as I follow a tutorial to build a **Track Calorie App**. The project is developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, and it focuses on creating a calorie tracker with a user-friendly interface and persistent storage functionality.

## UI Theme Setup

Setting up a clean and responsive user interface (UI) to provide a seamless user experience.

## Project Planning & Diagram

Visualizing the app's architecture and components through diagrams for better project organization.

## Key Features and Steps

1. **Base Classes**: Implementing the `Tracker`, `Meal`, and `Workout` classes.
2. **Display Features**: Showing tracker stats, progress bars, and calorie alerts.
3. **Interactivity**:
   - Adding new meals and workouts.
   - Refactoring to a single `_newItem` method for efficiency.
   - Displaying and removing meals and workouts dynamically.
   - Filtering and resetting tracker data.
   - Setting a custom calorie limit.
4. **Refactoring**: Continuously improving code structure for better maintainability.

## Local Storage Features

1. **Persisting Data**:
   - Total calories and calorie limit.
   - Meals and workouts.
2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Removing specific meals and workouts from local storage.
   - Clearing all storage items.
